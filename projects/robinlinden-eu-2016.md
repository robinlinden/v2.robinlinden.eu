## Description

Website I designed and made in 2016. This one is way brighter and most people seem to think it looks more professional.

### What I needed

Personal website to show off projects I've been working on. Maybe a blog.

### Technologies used

* [OpenPGP.js](https://openpgpjs.org/)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Formspree](https://formspree.io/)
