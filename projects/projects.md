## Games

### [unnamed 2D game-engine]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/game-engine)

This is a technical demonstration of a simple cross-platform 2D game engine I've been working on for a while. I'm temporarily using Cave Story sprites (and trying to mimic its physics pretty closely) to demonstrate what I currently have implemented in the engine.


## Websites
{: #web}

### [robinlinden.eu (2014)]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/robinlinden-eu-2014)

![Header, menu, and first paragraph of robinlinden.eu (2014).]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/projects/robinlinden-eu-2014.png)

My first attempt at making a website for myself. Turned out quite alright.

### [robinlinden.eu (2016)]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/robinlinden-eu-2016)

![Front page of robinlinden.eu in 2016.]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/projects/robinlinden-eu-2016.png)

Current iteration of my personal website. Now written with the help of a static website generator.

### [Ory AB]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/ory-se)

![Front page of ory-ab's website.]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/projects/ory-se-0.png)

Website I designed and created for [Ory AB](https://ory.robinlinden.eu), a company that manufactures trucks and trailers. Built in modern HTML5 and CSS3 with a material-design-inspired card-style design.


## Utilities

### [htaHex]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/htahex)

Windows HTML application (HTA) that allows you to view hexadecimal colours. Written in a weird combination of VB- and JavaScript.
