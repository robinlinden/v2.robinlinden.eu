## Description

This is the version of my personal website I made back in 2014.

### What I needed

A website where I could showcase my projects, (maybe) blog, and place my GPG key.

### What I learnt

* Responsive web design
* HTML5 & CSS3
* PHP (used for sending emails in this case)
* How nginx works
* Stay under [14.3(ish) KB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control#Congestion_window). The second you're over it, you're adding ~100ms to the load time of your website.
* How much I love optimisation
<p></p>

## Live version

You can see this version of the website in a semi-archived state at [v1.robinlinden.eu](https://v1.robinlinden.eu).
