![htaHex converting different colour codes into colours.]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/projects/htahex0.png)

Windows application that allows you to quickly see hexadecimal colours. [Download current version.]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/files/htahex.hta)

## Current features include:

* Grabbing a colour from clipboard when the program opens.
* Manual entry of colours in both #123 and #123123 format with or without the octothorpe.
* Exiting on ESC.

## Planned features:

* Making the colour darker or lighter (with up and down arrows?)
* Altering the hue of the colour (with left and right arrow?)
* Copy to clipboard on e.g. enter or ctrl+c for as long as the program is in focus, even if the text isn't selected.
