Hi. My name is Robin, I am a Swedish computer engineer, and this is the [second iteration](https://v1.robinlinden.eu/) of my website.

I work as a consultant (and run a consulting company) which means I have a fairly wide range of responsibilities, including setting up servers, networks, and writing software. Recently I've also been writing C++ in the field of robotics and automation which is pretty cool.

When I've got time off from my consulting gigs, I design and host websites for small businesses. Feel free to check some of them out over in my [portfolio]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects#web) if you're interested.

I am the maintainer of the [Toxcore](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/) crypto/communications library and the [uTox](https://github.com/uTox/uTox) security-oriented messenger client.

As of 2016, I'm part of the [Cmdline](https://cmdline.org/) security research organisation.

In 2014 I graduated from Örebro University in Sweden with a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering and I've since done a lot of different courses, both at Örebro University and elsewhere.

I spend way too much time in front of computers, usually gaming or [programming]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects). My non-computery interests are scuba diving, doing various university courses (mostly maths and computer science), traveling, reading, and drinking delicious alcohol or coffee.

My preferred programming language is C++, but I'm competent in a lot of them—notably C, C#, and Python.

My favourite projects in programming are complicated things: robotics; [game engine stuff]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/game-engine/); artificial intelligence; and combining sensors, microprocessors, and code.
