<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>It's a contact-form thing for static (html only) websites, so that's what I use it for. </p>

<h3>What do they store?</h3>
<p>They store the full contents of the last 100 emails sent via the contact form. However, all data you enter into my contact form is PGP-encrypted with a 4096-bit key (<a href="http://www.pgp.net/pgpnet/pgp-faq/pgp-faq-security-questions.html">uncrackable* even by the NSA</a>), so they can't see anything besides the fact that I got an email from someone using my website.</p>

<h3>How do I opt out?</h3>
<p>If you don't want your emails passing through them, just send a regular <a href="mailto:contact@robinlinden.eu">email</a> instead of using the form.</p>
